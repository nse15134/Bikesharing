## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the value of a bikesharing program in Des Moines.  We want to be able to quantify the value of the investment with different metrics that we have created in the published Tableau Dashboard.  We want to show the different data points and analyses that we have put together to the shareholders.
We viewed bike usage data by days, hours, gender, and more. Below, we will show visualizations around length of time the bikes were checked out for, number of bike trips for all riders and genders, and number of bike trips for each user and gender.
