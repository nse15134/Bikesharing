# Bikesharing - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nick.emery/viz/Bikesharing-Citibike/Story1?publish=yes

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the value of a bikesharing program in Des Moines.  We want to be able to quantify the value of the investment with different metrics that we have created in the published Tableau Dashboard.  We want to show the different data points and analyses that we have put together to the shareholders.
We viewed bike usage data by days, hours, gender, and more. Below, we will show visualizations around length of time the bikes were checked out for, number of bike trips for all riders and genders, and number of bike trips for each user and gender.

## Results - ![Story 1 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98061420/168499490-f56bd9fa-e173-4613-ab8f-ae4ccea39e4c.png)


Above, we can take a look at the trip duration by total users over hours 0-2, we can see a steady increase over the course of 0-2 hours.

Next we want to look at a similar analysis, but we want to add a gender component to it.  We can then see that there is a very large delta between Male and Female, Males are responsible for the steady increase in growth in this sample set.

Now we want to look at the total number of Trips by Weekeday per hour.  We can see certain data points stand out already as high-volume time periods.  We can see that during the week, the peak hours are normally 6-9AM and then again at 5-7PM.  During the weekend, 9AM-8PM is pretty strong for bikesharing.

![Story 1 (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98061420/168499721-305f6446-6943-4636-8773-db7b32bdbb24.png)

Similar to the above, we can add a gender component and analyze the delta and the drivers.  We can see a fair bit of different in behavior between the two genders.  It is a similiar viz for both, but we can see an increase on the male side and a bigger increase in Thursday/Friday afternoon.

![Story 1 (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98061420/168499815-e81c4622-1a86-4264-83ee-e75afc5ade28.png)

We want to take a look at both gender and user type (Subscriber/Customer).  We can clearly see a lot of this usage data driven by Male Subscribers


![Story 1 (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98061420/168499874-b63e0f23-3a23-4847-a8c3-add11639d694.png)

I also wanted to add a geographical piece for starting location by count of bikes as well as another gender component.

![Story 1 (7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98061420/168499895-83729b27-c5e7-4e56-8023-ffa8cb30f600.png)

Final is Peak Starting hours by Gender.


## Summary
In summary, we can see that Male trips are very high compared to women.  We can also see that usage during rush hour on the weekdays is very high, while there is a steady stream all day long on the weekends.
